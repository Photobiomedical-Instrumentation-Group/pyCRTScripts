# pyCRTScripts

User-friendly scripts designed to make pyCRT accessible to non-programmers.

# Usage

## Through the EXE file (Windows only)


## Through the command line

# To-do

This is a list of features I would like to implement (I don't promise I will
actually implement them all):

* Add option to view the plots and CRT before saving;
* Try to implement interactive fromTime, toTime and algorithm selection;
* Implement PCA results as a channel;
* Develop algorithm to find appropriate fromTime and toTime;
* Add fromTime and toTime to avgIntensPlot;
* Add monochrome as a possible channel;
* Add tests for pyCRTScripts;
* Add 9010 as an algorithm;
* Add timestamp to csv;
* Add input "Test another video?";
* Add tests;
* Output error messages to the log;
* Create specific exception types for not selecting the ROI and for failed CRT
  fit;
* Add option to ignore duplicates in multiVideoPipeline;
